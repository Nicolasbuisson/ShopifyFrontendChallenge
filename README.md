# Shopify Frontend Challenge

Hello all,

you can find my implementation of Shopify's Front-End Developer Intern Summer 2021 Challenge here: https://nicolasbuisson.github.io/ShopifyFrontendChallenge/

I hope you enjoy the design decisions I made regarding the styling. I wanted to go for an awards ceremony type of look: dark background with bright lights.
